# Bootstrap-false-discovery
This function is an implementation of Lallich et al.'s 2006 algorithm to reduce type I error (the false discovery rate) by selecting a subset of correlations with values deemed suitable or interesting by the researcher. The function writes its output in a data frame format suitable for graphing with the igraph package.
